<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This course examines labor-management relations in socio-legal
perspective, drawing on both traditional legal materials (i.e. statutes,
regulations, judicial opinions) and social research (i.e. theoretical
perspectives &amp; empirical studies from the social sciences). The aim
of the course is to provide students with an overview of significant
issues and doctrines in labor law, introduce students to theory and
research on labor unions and labor-management relations, and encourage
students to consider how insights from social theory and research can
inform legal practice.</p>
<p>After taking this course, students should be able to</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the system of labor-management relations under the National
Labor Relations Act, including the procedures for establishing union
representation, the collective bargaining process &amp; arbitration of
contractual disputes, the limits on employer and union conduct, and the
procedures for adjudicating unfair labor practices.</li>
<li>Explain the legal regulation of internal union affairs under the
Labor-Management Reporting &amp; Disclosure Act, including the conduct
of union elections, the reporting of union finances, and the rights of
union members.</li>
<li>Research the law, analyze issues, and advise clients on matters
involving the rights and duties of employers, employees, and labor
unions under the NLRA and LMRDA.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Grading</h4>

<section id="class-attendance-and-preparation" class="level4">
<h4>Class Attendance and Preparation</h4>
<p>Elon Law School has adopted the following attendance policy for all
courses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Law School administers a policy that a student maintain regular
and punctual class attendance in all courses in which the student is
registered, including externships, clinical courses, or simulation
courses. Faculty members will give students written notice of their
attendance policies before or during the first week of class. These
policies may include, but are not limited to: treating late arrivals,
early departures, and/or lack of preparation as absences; imposing grade
or point reductions for absences, including assigning a failing grade or
involuntarily withdrawing a student from the class; and any other
policies that a professor deems appropriate to create a rigorous and
professional classroom environment.</p>
<p>In case of illness or emergency, students may contact the Office of
Student and Professional Life, which will then notify the student’s
instructors. A student may notify the faculty member directly of a
planned absence and should refer to individual faculty members regarding
any policy that may apply. In the case of prolonged illness or
incapacity, the student should contact the Office of Student and
Professional Life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excessive absences (more than 2 classes) may result in a reduction of
your grade.</p>
<p>Elon Law School’s standards and ABA guidance for awarding course
credit assume at least two hours of out-of-class student work for each
hour of classroom instruction.</p>
